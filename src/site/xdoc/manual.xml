<title>IDS Plugin Interface</title>
</properties>

<body>

	<section name="The interface">
		<p>
			IDS plugins have three interfaces to implement.  Please see the 
			<a href="apidocs/index.html">Javadoc</a> for details.  The IDS has a two
			level storage model with main storage and an optional archive storage.
			The main storage deals with individual data files whereas the archive
			storage deals with zip files holding all the datafiles of a dataset.  In
			addition the ZipMapperInterface must be implemented to define the
			structure of the Zip file which is used for downloads and for archive
			storage.
		</p>


		<p>
			There are a number of abstract partial implementations provided - for
			example <a href="apidocs/org/icatproject/ids/plugin/MainStorageWithoutArchive.html">MainStorageWithoutArchive</a>
			and <a href="apidocs/org/icatproject/ids/plugin/MainStorageWithoutArchiveReadOnly.html">MainStorageWithoutArchiveReadOnly</a>
			which you may extend.  These provide dummy implementations of calls
			which are not made in specific deployments.
		</p>

	</section>

	<section name="Packaging">
		<p>
			For Glassfish deployment the IDS expects to find its plugins in
			lib/applibs below the domain directory.  The plugins must be packaged
			will all dependencies - because of the way the Glassfish classloader
			works and after deployment Glassfish must be redeployed.  Please see the
			<a href="http://repo.icatproject.org/site/ids/storage_file">file storage plugin</a>
			with <a href="https://github.com/icatproject/ids.storage_file">source code</a>
			as an example of how to do it.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section name="Security considerations">
		<p>
			When writing a plugin you have to provide methods that operate on your
			data: read it, check for its existence, write it, delete it and find
			information about it.
		</p>

		<p>
			The call put(DsInfo dsInfo, String name, InputStream inputStream) in the
			<a href="apidocs/org/icatproject/ids/plugin/MainStorageInterface.html">MainStorageInterface</a>
			is where you decide, using information about the data set that will hold
			the datafile and the name to be given to the datafile, a "location"
			value which is unique for your IDS instance and which can be used as an
			identifier to store and retrieve files.  It will be some kind of path
			relative to the storage system you are using.  The main danger is that
			someone will create a datafile object which has a location value which
			is not consistent with the policy you have defined in this "put" method.
			Such a location may cause data to be read that should be private or it
			could cause other people's data to be written or deleted.
		</p>

		<subsection name="The safe simple solution">
			<p>

				The simplest way to protect against all such dangers is to
				enable the generation of a cryptographic hash in the
				ids.properties file.  This results in the computation of a
				cryptographic hash which is appended to the location you return
				before storing the value in ICAT.  The hash is based on the "id"
				of the datafile, the "location" value as seen by the plugin and
				a key known only to the IDS and which is defined in the
				ids.properties file.  Each time the location from ICAT is passed
				to a plugin it is first check that the hash has the expected
				value and then the first part of the location field is passed to
				the plugin which will be guaranteed to be exactly what the
				original call to the put method returned.  The plugin is not
				exposed to the hash at all.  The value stored in icat is the
				location followed by the hash separated by a space.  The hash
				value goes at the end to help with indexing in some cases.
			</p>
		</subsection>

		<subsection name="Safe but restrictive solution">
			<p>
				If for some reason you don't want to follow the solution
				described above there are two approaches which are also safe but
				restrictive:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					You can make sure that only a few trusted people are
					authorized to create or update any datafile in
					ICAT.
				</li>
				<li>
					If you have a system without archive storage then only
					three plugin calls accept the location.  In each case,
					in addition to the location the createId and the modId
					of the datafile are passed in so that the plugin can see
					if this was a trusted person.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</subsection>

		<subsection name="Parts of a solution">
			<p>
				If you don't want the safe solution and in addition you cannot
				work with the restrictions in the previous section then there
				are some things that you can do to help make things safer:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					You can check that the location does not try to get
					outside the storage area and that it conforms to your
					rules by matching the location against a suitable
					regular expression.
				</li>
				<li>
					You can make sure that write operations will not
					overwrite existing files (for main storage).
				</li>
				<li>
					You can use UUIDs in the location that the “put” call
					generates to make the value unguessable.
				</li>
				<li>
					You can add uniqueness contraints on the
					Datafile.location in the database, using the following
					SQL statement: 
					<code>ALTER TABLE DATAFILE ADD CONSTRAINT UNQ_DATAFILE_LOCATION UNIQUE (LOCATION)</code>
					with a further similar statement if you wish to avoid
					duplicate Dataset.location values.  Note however that
					since these constraints are only enforced at the
					database level and not known to ICAT, you will get an
					INTERNAL error "Unexpected DB response" rather then an
					OBJECT_ALREADY_EXISTS error in the case of a violation.
				</li>
			</ul>
